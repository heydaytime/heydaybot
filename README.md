# HeyDayBot - Reminders and Memes

HeyDayBot is a Discord bot I built in late 2022, during the tail end of the COVID era. It was designed to help manage my online class schedule and add a little fun to my day with memes.

## ✨ Features

- ⏰ **Class Reminders**:  
  Automatically sent reminders a few minutes before each class, based on my school's daily timetable.
  
  Each reminder included:
  - 📚 Class name
  - 🔗 Zoom link
  - 🔐 Meeting password

- 📅 **Timetable-Aware**:  
  Fully synced with my school schedule. It knew what class was coming up and when.

- 😂 **Meme Command**:  
  Users could trigger a command to receive a random meme.

- 🏆 **Scoring System** *(Experimental)*:  
  There was also a basic scoring/points system, though I don’t remember exactly how it worked.

## 💭 Reflection

I really wish I had made this bot earlier—back in 2020 when online classes were at their peak. It would’ve saved me so much hassle. Unfortunately, HeyDayBot was only active for about a month.

Still, it was a fun and useful project while it lasted.
